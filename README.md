# Readme Generator

## Description 

In order to save development time, this application will create everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. The application works by utilizing the 'fs' and 'inquirer' modules by asking the user via Command Line what information they would like in their readme file. The motivation behind this project was to solve the frustration and the time it takes to create a well-formatted readme file.
